The `ConcurrentHashMap` is a thread-safe implementation of the `Map` interface in Java. It is designed to provide high concurrency performance by allowing multiple threads to perform read and write operations simultaneously without the need for external synchronization. Here's how `ConcurrentHashMap` works internally:

1. **Data Structure**: `ConcurrentHashMap` internally uses an array of bucketed nodes (`Node` objects) to store the key-value pairs. Each bucket in the array is a linked list of nodes. The array size is always a power of 2, which helps in efficient hashing and resizing operations.

2. **Concurrency Control**: `ConcurrentHashMap` employs a combination of techniques to achieve thread-safety and high concurrency:

   a. **Lock Striping**: Instead of using a single lock for the entire map, `ConcurrentHashMap` uses multiple locks, one for each segment (a segment is a portion of the map's buckets). This approach reduces contention by allowing multiple threads to access different segments concurrently.

   b. **Synchronization at Bucket Level**: Within each segment, further synchronization is performed at the bucket level using synchronized blocks or lock-free techniques like `CAS` (Compare-And-Swap) operations.

3. **Key Operations**:

   a. **Put (Add)**: When adding a new key-value pair, the hash code of the key is calculated, and the corresponding segment and bucket are determined. If the bucket is empty, a new node is created and added using a `CAS` operation. If the bucket is occupied, the thread acquires the lock for that bucket and updates the linked list.

   b. **Get**: To retrieve a value associated with a key, the hash code of the key is calculated, and the corresponding segment and bucket are determined. The thread traverses the linked list in that bucket without acquiring any locks, taking advantage of the immutable nature of linked nodes. This allows concurrent reads without blocking other threads.

   c. **Remove**: To remove a key-value pair, the hash code of the key is calculated, and the corresponding segment and bucket are determined. The thread acquires the lock for that bucket and traverses the linked list, removing the node containing the key if found.

4. **Resizing**: When the number of elements in the map exceeds a certain threshold, `ConcurrentHashMap` initiates a resizing operation to increase the capacity of the internal array. This is done in a multithreaded manner, where multiple threads can participate in the resizing process simultaneously, each responsible for transferring a portion of the nodes to the new array.

5. **Iterators**: `ConcurrentHashMap` provides fail-safe iterators that do not throw `ConcurrentModificationException`. However, the iterators may reflect the state of the map at some point during iteration, meaning that they may or may not reflect modifications made to the map after the iterator was created.

The key advantages of `ConcurrentHashMap` are:

- **High Concurrency**: Multiple threads can read and write concurrently with minimal contention and blocking.
- **Lock Striping**: Reduces contention by allowing concurrent access to different segments of the map.
- **Efficient Reads**: Read operations do not require acquiring locks, thanks to the immutable nature of linked nodes.
- **Dynamic Resizing**: The map can efficiently grow in size as more elements are added, without disrupting concurrent operations.

However, it's important to note that `ConcurrentHashMap` is not a drop-in replacement for the standard `HashMap` in all scenarios. It has a higher memory overhead due to the additional synchronization mechanisms and data structures used for concurrency control. Additionally, the performance of `ConcurrentHashMap` may vary depending on the level of contention and the ratio of read/write operations.
